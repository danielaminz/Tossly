# Tossly
Group 17, Cyber Physical Systems 2025–26

Tossly is a physical digital Rock Paper Scissors scoreboard that replaces screens with motion. It recognises two players' hand gestures using computer vision and machine learning, then communicates results through a mechanical seven segment display, a theatrical fan reveal, and a motor driven music box. The project explores how devices can express intelligence through movement, timing, and materials rather than pixels or voice.
